# Bloglist

A web app made using React as a part of the Full Stack Open online course. Made by combining [part 4](https://github.com/dakshj48/FSO2019/tree/master/part4) and [part 7](https://github.com/dakshj48/FSO2019/tree/master/part7/bloglist).

This application enables the users to add their blogs in a list of blogs so that the people who are interested in a topic can find articles related to that topic. 

Users can add new blogs to the list, like and comment on existing blogs in the list and remove the blogs that they have added.
